# PBX Getbox renders download app

App checks and downloads render files from printbox server to local server and unpacks.
App is using CPU threads so the fetchers run concurrently. So downloading and unpacking render files is alot faster.

**Check changelog for changes**

## Usage

Setup config first! Copy ```config.example.yml``` and rename to ```config.yml```

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)  
Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  

If you have docker installed in server then use ```docker-compose up -d```
This runs app forever and checking. App is doing interval checks after time set in config.

Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)  

Running only once you need server to have go installed and then use ```go run main.go run_once```
